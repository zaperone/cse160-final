**Team members:** Group 9: Hoa Bui, Andrew Johnson, Yuhan(Melody) Su, Jiaqiang Yuan

**Title of our team project:** Factors that Affect the Salary of Data Analysts&#39; job.

**The dataset we will use** : Data Analyst Jobs[**https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs**](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs)

**The motivation of our tasks** : To investigate what are the factors that affect the salary of a job. (specifically data analyst jobs).In this case, we ourselves and classmates are our &quot;target&quot; as we are the ones looking into data science jobs as a possible future career.

**The data&#39;s size:** 7.22 MB - 2254 rows - 16 columns

**Target customer(s)**: People who are unemployed and/or are interested in career prospects in the data analysis field.

**The benefits of our project:** The benefit is to us and our classmates, as we can hopefully provide some insight as to what acts as indicators of a high salary in a data analyst position.

**Tasks to be done:**

**1)Cleaning:** Remove NA values and irrelevant values. Replace -1 with NA

**2)Visualization:** We would like to explore visualizations based on this dataset since it contains interesting features like salary estimate, location, a company rating, and job description. This way, we could identify emerging trends and graphically represent them.

**3)Clustering :** the range of salary based onlocation

**4)Text analysis:** analyze if some keyword in the &quot;job description&quot; column would affect the salary. Apply some text mining technique we have learned in the class

**How to evaluate success?**

As a team we are aware that even though correlation might happen with the relationships we are investigating (between locations, job description, rating, etc and salary), causation does not always come behind it. We will access our success by determining whether or not there is a strong correlation between top salary and metropolitan location, between top salary and certain keywords that refer to advanced data analysis skills, and between top salary and best companies&#39; rating. If there is, we can conclude that there are certain causation behind top salary for data analyst jobs.
